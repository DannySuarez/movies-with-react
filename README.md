This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Concept
1. Successfully Refactor Class Components in to Functional Components
1. Successfully implements useState, and useEffect Hooks for state and api calls
1. Use async/await and try/catch blocks

## Notes
This is based on a tutoria from 2017 that uses Class Components and Lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount.

To have a better understanding of Functional Components and React Hooks I refactored code as I followed along.

Fetch calls are made using the http://themoviedb.com/ api. Check out https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api for more information

If you'd like to compare files, Functionl Components implementing Hooks live in the functionalComponents directory and Class Components live in the classComponents directory.
